# Dosvid Personal Planner

## About the project
_Dosvid_ is an application for structuring your personal development.


## Design 
Level progression system:
- earned experience points
- goals
  - add, edit, complete, delete.
  - history view of completed goals
- Reward management

## Implementation
#### Typescript 
#### Tailwind 
#### React
#### State management 


## Optimisation 
#### Performance Testing 
Bottleneck was the bundle size. 
#### Bundle analysis 


## Usage 
Current application is in a demonstration state. It has some pre-loaded goals and rewards, for illustration purposes. 
You can, however, clear history, goals, and rewards if they bother you, and fully use the application. 
It has 11 levels, with gradually increasing experience goals. 
The recommended "difficulty scaling" is approximately 1 extra day of work, per level, beginning with 1 day.
## Challenges

#### Feature Creep 
The nature of this project permits it to be ambitious and all-reaching in terms of inspiration for features and future prospects. 
A game-like mechanic of level progression opens up to a whole world of Role-Playing Game elements that can be introduced. 
At the same time, the "data" side, with earning points daily over time, invites statistical analysis, visualisations, graphs and charts, and much more. 

Recognising these "magnetic poles" as fertile ground for feature creep has allowed me to establish a strict MVP very early in the development, outlining exactly the features that are the core functionality of the _Dosvid_ system. 

#### Dependency Externalisation 
As described in [performance testing](#Optimisation), the bottleneck of the loading speed was the size of react-dom dependency.
